⏺ Ralph Wiggum Technique

  The Ralph Wiggum technique is an iterative development methodology that uses
  continuous AI loops for self-improving development work.

  Core Concept

  while :; do
    cat PROMPT.md | claude-code --continue
  done

  The same prompt is fed repeatedly. Claude sees its own previous work in files
   and git history, enabling iterative improvement without feeding output back
  as input.

  Each iteration:
  1. Claude receives the SAME prompt
  2. Works on the task, modifying files
  3. Tries to exit
  4. Stop hook intercepts and feeds the same prompt again
  5. Claude sees its previous work in the files
  6. Iteratively improves until completion

  The technique is described as "deterministically bad in an undeterministic
  world" - failures are predictable, enabling systematic improvement through
  prompt tuning.

  Available Commands

  /ralph-loop <PROMPT> [OPTIONS]

  Start a Ralph loop in your current session.

  Usage:
  /ralph-loop "Refactor the cache layer" --max-iterations 20
  /ralph-loop "Add tests" --completion-promise "TESTS COMPLETE"

  Options:
  - --max-iterations <n> - Max iterations before auto-stop
  - --completion-promise <text> - Promise phrase to signal completion

  How it works:
  1. Creates .claude/.ralph-loop.local.md state file
  2. You work on the task
  3. When you try to exit, stop hook intercepts
  4. Same prompt fed back
  5. You see your previous work
  6. Continues until promise detected or max iterations

  /cancel-ralph

  Cancel an active Ralph loop (removes the loop state file).

  Key Concepts

  Completion Promises

  To signal completion, output a <promise> tag:

  <promise>TASK COMPLETE</promise>

  The stop hook looks for this specific tag. Without it (or --max-iterations),
  Ralph runs infinitely.

  Self-Reference Mechanism

  - Same prompt repeated
  - Claude's work persists in files
  - Each iteration sees previous attempts
  - Builds incrementally toward goal

  Example

  /ralph-loop "Fix the token refresh logic in auth.ts. Output 
  <promise>FIXED</promise> when all tests pass." --completion-promise "FIXED"
  --max-iterations 10

  Ralph will:
  - Attempt fixes
  - Run tests
  - See failures
  - Iterate on solution
  - Continue until tests pass or max iterations reached

  When to Use Ralph

  Good for:
  - Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria
  - Tasks requiring iteration and refinement
  - Iterative development with self-correction
  - Greenfield projects

  Not good for:
  - Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions
  - One-shot operations
  - Tasks with unclear success criteria
  - Debugging production issues (use targeted debugging instead)
